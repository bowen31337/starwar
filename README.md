# Introduction

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Other Dependencies
Typescript, Redux-Observable, RxJs

# Functionalities
The app should display a table containing the list of people https://swapi.dev/api/people/) with the following columns;

· Name

· Height

· Mass.

It should also support pagination (next and back button), so the user can navigate to the next page (if present)

Once the user clicks on the table row, the detail section of the app should be populated with the following details about the person.

· Name

· Birth year

· Gender

· Names of the films that this person has been in.
